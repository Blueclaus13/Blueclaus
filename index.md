        <p>Yosemite is a magic place that makes me feel like in a fairstory. There are Secuayas Trees, they are giant. I found mushroms, variaty of animals and plants. It's a extrem temperture place: the summers are too hot and the winters are too cold. I love the color or the rocks and the water in the rivers is clear and clean. </p>
        <p>This place has impressive landscapes, you should visit it. </p>
